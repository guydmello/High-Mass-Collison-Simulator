# Physics Calculator
This is a Physics calculator built using HTML, Javascript, CSS deployed at https://guydmello.github.io/Physics-Calculator/

We present to astrophysics-themed calculators. These calculators feature Gravitational Force, Force, Acceleration, and Friction Calculations.
These are tremendously useful for physicists to easily calculate by adding inputs and receiving a correct calculation. 
For this Astro project, we also added a space-themed background and animations to enhance the UI and quality of life design.

You put your inputs here and then hit CALCULATE which will instantly output your solution and when switching calculators will reset your previous output. So whenever you have physics-related calculations which require the use of any formulas, this is a useful and easy way to perform quick calculations. 

We hope you enjoy
